# TSLint Angular

Typescript linter using Codelyzer for static code analysis.

This configuration is tested and recommended to use with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). Configuration is based on [Angular Styleguide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). Feel free to propose new rules.

Notice that in pure Angular CLI there's no Codelyzer configured.

## How to run
`ng lint`
